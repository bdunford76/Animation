// Define a class that creates a spiral
// A class is just a way to group data (properties) together
// with behaviour (things that we want to happen)
class IndivudualSpiral  {
    
    //1. PRoperties
    //
    // A property is something thaty describes the item
    // e.g : A student at LCS has a house, a hair colour, a height
    
    
    // 2. Initializer
    //
    // An Initalizer has one job: give each property an initial
    //value
    
    //3. Methods
    // here we decide what behaviour we want to have happen
